# Advent of Code 2025

I wanted to learn Effect better, so I decided to use Effect to do Advent of Code 2025.
There's a Next.js app, with ShadCN, Tailwind, and Effect, along with Biome and Effect language server.

The aim is to use Effect RPC and Effect Atom to make an Http API to pass the data to the backend for processing
and returning to the frontend, along with any errors, for the frontend to display as appropriate.
